You feel refreshed and ready to take on the day.
You say hello to your dad and begin getting ready to go to work.
You start the ignition of the car and pull out of the driveway.
You find your station and sit down to read the daily workload.
You spend the next 3 hours writing the most efficient code you have ever seen in your life and head off to lunch.
The thing you were think about is your favourite tv shows new season, your favourite game series' new release and the pizza you will have for dinner.
Having completed all your work in the previous work period, you sleep at your desk as your manager walks straight past you.
Lovely smells, lovely sights. The tall trees swallow you up pleasantly as you walk around the park. You walk around peacefully for a couple of hours before making your way back home.
He says he needs to talk to you as you both head towards the living room. He sits you down and talks about how he proud he is of you and gives you a small deposit for an apartment you've been looking into.
You spend the next thirty minutes making a delectable four course meal including crab, pork and beef wellington. After eating the entire meal you feel stuffed, but happy.
As you're getting ready for bed, you put on your adult minecraft onesie, brush your teeth and get under the covers. You reflect on the day you had and smile as you slowly drift into your dreams.
