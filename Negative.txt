You get up, slip and smash your head on the floor.
You are scared by the man, causing you to run away and slam your head into a door. (He's your dad. What is wrong with you?!)
You attempt to start the ignition and nothing happens. You hear a gentle hissing. After lifting the bonnet of the car and seeing a python, you decide to walk to work.
Despite working here for 3 years, you manage to get lost. After one hour, your manager finds you wondering around the rooftop of the building and berates you for being late. He then escorts you to your station.
You spend the next 3 hours writing three thousand If statements and cry on your lunch break.
The thing you think about is how lonely and sad you are and how you still live with your parents. You also think about how you have to wake up early again tomorrow.
As you boot up the workfile, you notice that you forgot to backup the data and the file has corrupted. You wallow in shame as your manager walks past and tells you to get back to work.
The second you arrive at the park a rabid dog, who appears to be foaming from the mouth, bolts towards you and chases you around the park. After half an hour of running in circles, you sprint for your home.
