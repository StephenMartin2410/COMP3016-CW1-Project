You wake up from a long slumber, stretch your arms out and stand up from your bed.
You walk downstairs and are greeted by a large man ominously lurking in the living room.
After getting ready for work, you walk outside and sit in your newly loaned company car.
Arriving at work, you swiftly enter the building and begin to head to your station. On the way to your station you greet and smile at all your coworkers.
After reading your work for the day, you begin developing the character physics for the companies newest game.
You head to the work cafeteria and pick the perfect seat in the corner so that you're not bothered. You dig into your lunch and think about your life.
Having finished your lunch, you then go back to your desk and begin working again.
Four hours later, you leave work and head to the local park for a quick walk through nature.
After arriving back home, you open the front door and bump into your dad.
After finishing the long winded conversation with your father, you then decide to begin making your dinner.
This day has been very taxing on you, so you head upstairs to get ready for bed.
