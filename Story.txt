You wake up from a long slumber, stretch your arms and get out of bed.
You walk downstairs and are greeted by a large man in the living room.
After getting ready for work, you walk outside and sit in your car.
Arriving at work, you enter the building and begin to head to your station.
After reading your work for the day, you begin developing on the companies newest game.
You dig into your lunch and think about <insert lunch thinking topic here>
Having finished your lunch, you then go back to your desk and begin working again.
Four hours later, you leave work and head to the local park for a quick walk through nature.
After arriving back home, you open the front door and bump into your dad.
After finishing the long winded conversation with your father, you then decide to begin making your dinner.
This day has been very taxing on you, so you head upstairs to get ready for bed.
